# graal-test

An experiment using Clojure and the embedded polyglot languages

## Usage

First you need to download the [Graal project](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html) so that you will have access to it through `java`

Next, configure your PATH to include the java from the Graal project bin that you just downloaded
```
# export PATH=/path/to/graalAndTruffle/bin:$PATH
```

Now, you can start up a REPL with the leiningen just like you regularly do:

`lein repl`

Run the examples through the REPL and have fun!
